# Early-Detection-of-Brain-Stroke
Stroke is a condition that happens when the blood flow to the brain is impaired or diminished. It is also referred to as Brain Circulatory Disorder. It is now possible to predict when a stroke will start by using ML approaches thanks to advancements in medical technology.

Problem statement:
Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in the world. Early stroke detection and treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. Current methods for detecting stroke, on the other hand, rely heavily on clinical expertise and can be time-consuming, resulting in
delayed diagnosis and treatment.Machine learning techniques have the potential to improve early stroke detection by analyzing large amounts of medical data and identifying patterns that could indicate a stroke.

Objectives:
1.The primary goal of this project is to detect the onset of a stroke as early as possible.
2.Early detection of a stroke can result in faster treatment and better patient outcomes. Early detection and treatment can reduce brain damage and the risk of long-term disability or death.
3.Machine learning algorithms can assist in identifying specific stroke risk factors and customizing treatment plans to the individual patient.
4.Large amounts of patient data can be analyzed by machine learning algorithms to provide insights into stroke risk factors and treatment outcomes. This data can be used to improve stroke prevention and treatment strategies.

Proposed methodology:
In this project, we propose early prediction of stroke disease using different machine learning approaches with the occurrence of hypertension, BMI level, heart disease, average glucose level, smoking status, previous stroke and age.

Using these high features attributes ,ten different classifiers have been trained, namely:
1.DecisionTree Classifier
2.RandomForest Classifier
3.AdaBoost Classifier
4.BernoulliNB
5.neural network
6.Bagging Classifier
7.LGBM Classifier
8.Support Vector Classifier
9.KNeighbors Classifier
10.Logistic Regression

Finally after comparing the accuracies of the above set of algorithms.the most accurate model is depolyed to the designed website using Flask framework
